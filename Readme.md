# Card game

## Problem Statement
> Playing cards have always been fascinating for mathematicians and logicians. Right from the fact that the number of card shuffles possible are more than the atoms on earth (There are 80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (67 zeros) ways to arrange a deck of 52 cards) to the fact that you could beat some of the biggest casinos by using high school level math; a simple deck of playing cards have always intrigued, amused and sometimes bewildered us.

Pick one card game(Solitaire, Hearts, Rummy, Cheat, BlackJack, Mahjong etc) that you want to implement. It's fine if you want to implement more than one card game. Create the full featured game as a web application that runs on any modern browser and deploy it.
